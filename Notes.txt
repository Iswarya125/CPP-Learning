1. Constructor and destructor can be called explicitly.
2. Calling the constructor will create temporary object and it will be destructed (Calls destructor) soon after the execution of constructor call line.
3. Destructor can be called by using above created object explicitly but compiler will anyway call that as mentioned above.
4. To call destructor explicitly object.destructor() this is the way or constructor().destructor()

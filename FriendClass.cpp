// 1. Keyword "friend" is used to make some [function OR class] as friend of your class.
// 2. Friend function OR friend class can access private/public/protected Data Member OR Member Functions of another class.
// 3. Function can not become friend of another function.
// 4. Class can not become friend of function.
// 5. Friendship is not mutual. If a class A is friend of B, then B doesnâ€™t become friend of A automatically.
// 6. Friendship is not inherited.
// Eg use case for friend - during unit testing, Manager->employee relationship

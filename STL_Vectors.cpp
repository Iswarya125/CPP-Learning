//Vectors combine the good features of both linked list (dynamic size) and classical array (faster access of elements O(1))
//Use reserve method to reserve some initial memory and compiler may not require to create more arrays whenever we push back elements into vector 
//Using reserve method is an optimized way of using vectors.
